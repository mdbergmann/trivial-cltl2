;;;; clamiga.lisp — CLtL2 compatibility layer for CL-Amiga.
;;;;
;;;; trivial-cltl2 delegates every name to an implementation package
;;;; (sb-cltl2, ccl, hcl, ...).  CL-Amiga has no such package — its
;;;; compiler does not expose a reified lexical environment — so this
;;;; file provides minimal implementations that satisfy the actual
;;;; callers in the ecosystem (trivia, serapeum), documenting where
;;;; each one diverges from AMOP/CLtL2 semantics.  Loaded only under
;;;; #+cl-amiga (see trivial-cltl2.asd :if-feature).

;;; --- Declaration registry ---
;;;
;;; DEFINE-DECLARATION registers a user declaration identifier + its
;;; handler; DECLARATION-INFORMATION queries the registry.  Without a
;;; reified lexical environment, we can only answer "globally proclaimed"
;;; — which is exactly what (proclaim '(declaration NAME)) tracks.  We
;;; therefore keep the last value a handler would have produced in a
;;; global table, keyed by declaration-name, and hand it back on query.
;;;
;;; This is enough for trivia's OPTIMIZER declaration (it proclaims the
;;; declaration once and then either queries it or falls back to
;;; *OPTIMIZER*) and for serapeum's FBOUNDP-gated OPTIMIZE probe.
